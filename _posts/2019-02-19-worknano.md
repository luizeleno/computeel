The workshop **[WorkNano 2019]** - *"Materials Science addressed with modern analytical and theoretical methods"* is to be held at São Paulo from 21st to 22nd of February of 2019.

I'll be one of the speakers of the conference, with a short talk (15min) entitled *“Ab-initio DFT calculations applied to superconducting materials”*

I'll soon post here the pdf with the slides I used for the talk, plus a few pictures taken during the workshop.
