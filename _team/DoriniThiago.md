I was born in Jundiaí/SP in 1994 and lived there with my family for seventeen years, until the decisive time for career choosing came unnoticeably fast. At that time, nearly all my cousins were studying engineering (and I have a lot of them, my family is huge), so I decided to take that road too. In 2012, I started my studies in Materials Engineering at the Lorena School of Engineering ([EEL]) -  University of São Paulo ([USP]), where I was very fortunate and got my degree in 2017, leaving this first cycle with a lot of new friends from all over the world. During this period, I met many passionate researchers that I am very grateful for teaching me - they were the ones that gave my nickname *van Helsing*, (which, by the way, please don't ask the reason why, it is embarrassing), in special Prof. Luiz T. F. Eleno, who was my advisor (and also became a great friend) in my Scientific Initiation in phase diagrams, introducing me to the research area.  In 2018 I started my master study on Materials Science with my in-progress dissertation *“Defect structure of the Cr5(Si,B)3 and Cr5(B,Si)3 (T1 and T2) compounds”*. I hope to one day become a researcher as good as those I met at my university.
