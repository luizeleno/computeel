I was born in 1976 in São Paulo (SP), Brazil. I finished my graduation in Metallurgical Engineering from the **Polytechnic School** ([EP-USP], *Escola Politécnica*) of the University of São Paulo ([USP]) in 2001, and soon started my master's degree in the same institution, with the [dissertation] *"Incorporation of Volume as a variable in the Cluster Variation Method"* (in portuguese), defended in 2003. After that, I moved to Germany, where I spent four and a half years stewing on beer and working at the **Max Planck Institute for Iron Research** ([MPIE], *Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung*) in  Düsseldorf from 2003 to 2008. There I fell (literally) from the train, breaking my right leg, inside which I still carry three pins and a metal plate - sealing my symbiosis with Metallurgy. Soon after, and still on crutches, I met the love of my life, also from São Paulo, coincidences. We went together to Toulouse, France, for another six months, where I was a guest researcher at the **Université de Toulouse**'s *Center Interuniversitaire de Recherche et d'Ingénierie des Matériaux* ([CIRIMAT]. We then returned to Brazil, where I defended my [doctoral thesis] titled *"Empirical and ab initio data in the CALPHAD method: the Fe-Cr-Mo-C and Nb-Ni-Si systems"* (in portuguese) in 2012 at EP-USP. Right after, I dedicated myself to a Post-Doctorate in Physics in the **Institute of Physics** ([IF-USP], *Instituto de Física*) of USP until 2014. Finished that, my activities began as a professor in the Department of Materials Engineering ([Demar]), part of the Lorena School of Engineering ([EEL]) of USP, in the city of Lorena, São Paulo, where I finally tied my mule, which I sometimes untie to enjoy beer around the world. When I am not dedicating myself to these activities, I perform ab-initio and CALPHAD calculations, probing into the electronic and thermal properties of materials for several applications. I also teach Thermodynamics, Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics and Scientific Computing to future Materials and Physical Engineers.

Apart from all that, my other passion is reading: classical literature, history and travel books are my favorite subjects. You find on my [instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/elenoluiz/) some of the reviews I write from time to time, though I'm planning to clone them into goodreads. They were written in portuguese, but the automatic translation is not bad (most of the time). I like also to play the guitar (classical, acoustic guitar) and I can do some astounding card tricks, just for fun.
