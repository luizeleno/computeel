I'm a 22-year-young Physical Engineer - i.e., neither a blue-ribbon physicist nor a tough, old-school engineer, but a messy entanglement of both - from the Lorena School of Engineering ([EEL]), University of São Paulo ([USP] ), Brazil. While still an undergrad I met Prof. Luiz T. F. Eleno (aka #Elenão) and started my long-road adventure in Computational Solid State Physics, with some tricky and cool unusual superconducting materials. It was love at first sight - for the Physics, not for Luiz, let me make that clear. Right after I completed my bachelor's degree with honors (at least my mom was very proud of me) midyear in 2018, I started my master studies on Computational Materials Science with my in-progress dissertation *"Ab-initio investigation of electronic and phononic properties of superconducting TMDs"*. I still have a long and go-ahead journey to become a great scientist, but certainly, as you can see here in the website, I'll enjoy a very nice company and some beer along the way.
