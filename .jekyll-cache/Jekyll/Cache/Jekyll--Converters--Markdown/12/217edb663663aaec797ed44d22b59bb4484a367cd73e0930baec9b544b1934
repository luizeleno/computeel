I"Ç<p>I‚Äôm a 22-year-young Physical Engineer - i.e., neither a blue-ribbon physicist nor a tough, old-school engineer, but a messy entanglement of both - from the Lorena School of Engineering (<a href="https://site.eel.usp.br/">EEL</a>), University of S√£o Paulo (<a href="https://www5.usp.br/">USP</a> ), Brazil. While still an undergrad I met Prof. Luiz T. F. Eleno (aka #Elen√£o) and started my long-road adventure in Computational Solid State Physics, with some tricky and cool unusual superconducting materials. It was love at first sight - for the Physics, not for Luiz, let me make that clear. Right after I completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree with honors (at least my mom was very proud of me) midyear in 2018, I started my master studies on Computational Materials Science with my in-progress dissertation <em>‚ÄúAb-initio investigation of electronic and phononic properties of superconducting TMDs‚Äù</em>. I still have a long and go-ahead journey to become a great scientist, but certainly, as you can see here in the website, I‚Äôll enjoy a very nice company and some beer along the way.</p>
