I hail from Pitangueiras, a small town in the countryside of São Paulo, Brazil. I was born in 2001 and, from a very young age, I was very interested in understanding how the universe around me works. During highschool, I decided to graduate in Engineering, but I had no idea which kind of engineer I would like to be.

In 2019, Physics Engineering chose me. I began my graduation course in Lorena School of Engineering (EEL-USP). It was there that I had my first contact with scientific computing and programming. At my first year in college, I’ve met Prof. Luiz Eleno. With him, I developed a scientific project that guided me even more to the path of scientific computing. Nowadays, I joined ComputEEL/MatSci, where I started a undergraduate research (IC) project.
