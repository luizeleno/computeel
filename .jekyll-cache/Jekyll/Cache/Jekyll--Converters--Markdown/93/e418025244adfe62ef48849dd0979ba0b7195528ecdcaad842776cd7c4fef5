I"F<p>I hail from Pitangueiras, a small town in the countryside of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I was born in 2001 and, from a very young age, I was very interested in understanding how the universe around me works. During highschool, I decided to graduate in Engineering, but I had no idea which kind of engineer I would like to be.</p>
