I was born in a small city in the interior of the state of Rio de Janeiro named Paraíba do Sul. I’m 22 years old and I have always been curious about how things are made. When I was in High School, I was really good at STEM subjects, especially Chemistry. So, of course, I thought about studying Chemical Engineering.

I started my graduate course in 2018 at Lorena School of Engineering (EEL–USP). But, in 2020, I realized that I didn’t, in fact, like Chemistry that much. Actually, I prefer Computer Science, Programming, and Physics. Therefore, in 2021 I transferred to Engineering Physics, at the same Campus and University (so far, I'm enjoying it a lot more than Chemistry).

I’ve read a lot about Quantum Physics and all its weirdness, but it wasn't until I started taking Quantum Mechanics classes that I saw in it my new passion. So, I contacted Prof. Luiz Eleno, who was the teacher of this class and he introduced me to the ComputEEL/MatSci Group. With them, I’m initiating undergraduate research in the field of Science Computing, Quantum Mechanics, and Superconductors Materials.
