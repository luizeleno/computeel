I"H<p>I was born in a small city in the interior of the state of Rio de Janeiro named Paraíba do Sul. I’m 22 years old and I have always been curious about how things are made. When I was in High School, I was really good at STEM subjects, especially Chemistry. So, of course, I thought about studying Chemical Engineering.</p>
