I"ú<p>I started my journey in Physics as an experimentalist with
<a href="http://www.demar.eel.usp.br/docentes/durval-rodrigues-junior.html">Durval Rodrigues Jr.</a>,
performing characterization of superconducting materials, e.g. magnesium diboride. 
When I attended my first conference, however, my interest in doing theoretical research was born.
Since there was no theoretical group on <a href="http://www.demar.eel.usp.br/">EEL</a> at 
the time, I started to learn about first-principles calculations by myself and
used it to study the materials investigated on Durvalâ€™s lab. Luckily, the
ComputEEL/MatSci group, led by <a href="/team/01-luizeleno.html">Luiz Eleno</a>,
had just started at the time, from which I could learn a lot. Finally, I joined
forces with <a href="/team/WeberGabrielle.html">Gabrielle Weber</a>,
who still teaches me a lot about analytical methods.</p>

<p>All this tortuous and enriching path during my bachelor studies opened the doors
for my ongoing PhD on electronic and topological properties of nanosystems.
Most of the time, I am bridging between first-principles, tight-binding and analytical
methods looking for insights about nanosystems. It amazes me the challenge of 
coming up with simple effective models for complicated systems.</p>
