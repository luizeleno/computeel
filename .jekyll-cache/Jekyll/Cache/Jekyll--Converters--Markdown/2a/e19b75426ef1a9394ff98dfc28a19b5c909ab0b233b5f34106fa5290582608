I"Æ<p>During my undergrad studies, I had to hand-type every single reference into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bib</code> file to be used with $Bib\TeX$. These days are gone! Nowadays, all you need is the <a href="https://www.doi.org/">doi</a> <em>(digital object identifier)</em> attached to a reference and use an api <em>(application programming interface)</em> found on <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">crossref.org</a>.</p>
