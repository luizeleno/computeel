During my undergrad studies, I had to hand-type every single reference into a `bib` file to be used with $Bib\TeX$. These days are gone! Nowadays, all you need is the [doi] *(digital object identifier)* attached to a reference and use an api *(application programming interface)* found on [crossref.org].

For instante, let's say you want the details of a paper with the following doi:
> 10.1103/PhysRevB.98.045126

To get the entry in `bib` format, just type the following string into the  address bar of your favorite web browser:
> [http://api.crossref.org/works/10.1016/0956-716X(95)00357-2/transform/application/x-bibtex]

Click on the link above and see the result. All you have to do is copy and paste the result into your `bib` file and, with little or no tweaking, you're done.

[doi]: https://www.doi.org/
[crossref.org]: https://www.crossref.org/
