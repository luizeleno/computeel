I was born in 2002 in a small county in São Paulo, Brazil. My family is mostly composed of  administrative positions, a fact that made it more difficult to find myself in engineering. Despite of that, early in my high school I decided the path I would try to follow, which led me to Lorena School of Engineering (EEL–USP), where I became a Physical Engineering undergrad. In my first year in college I discovered a passion for Scientific Computing, and this was what led me to one to Prof. Luiz Eleno, and the ComputEEL/MatSci Group, in which I recently started a research project.
