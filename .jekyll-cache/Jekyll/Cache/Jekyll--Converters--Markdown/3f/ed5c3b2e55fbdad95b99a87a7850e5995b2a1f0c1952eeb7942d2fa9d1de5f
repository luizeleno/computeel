<p>Two team members of ComputEEL/MatSci, <a href="/computeel/team/01-luizeleno.html">Luiz T. F. Eleno</a> and <a href="/computeel/team/YamamotoIgor.html">Igor Hideki</a>,  are taking part in the <em>Autumn Meeting of the Brazilian Society of Physics</em> (<a href="http://www.sbfisica.org.br/~eosbf/2019/index.php/en/">EOSBF2019</a>) in Aracaju, capital of the state of Sergipe, in northeastern Brazil.</p>

<p>Aracaju is a very hot town, full of beaches, coconut trees, crabs, shrimp and lots of natural beauties that makes it a splendid spot to hold a Physics conference!</p>

<p>Therefore, we came here to show our results on brand new work performed by our younger team member, <a href="/computeel/team/YamamotoIgor.html">Igor Hideki</a>, and also a proposal for a new python class to perform elasticity theory calculations â€” more on that in the future.</p>
