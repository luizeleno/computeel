**{{site.title}} page is up and running!** :fireworks: :tada:

The name of the lab, **{{site.title}}**, reflects a directory-tree-like hierarchy: *MatSci* is like a subfolder of *ComputEEL*, indicating that there are more groups at our institution ([EEL-USP]) doing scientific computations. We at **{{site.title}}** are doing computational research relevant to Materials Science. That being said, the other groups are completely independent of our lab and, therefore, are not necessarily linked in this website, insofar as they have no ongoing collaborations with us. That can, of course, change in the future.

Check our [news] to see some of the activities happening at our lab and with our [team]. Our [blog posts] also tell a bit more about our work, but contain also tips and tricks on miscellaneous topics.

You will also find a complete list of our scientific [publications]. Full references are given, including doi and Bib$\TeX$, so that you can easily cite us :wink:!

To reach us, find my e-mail address at the bottom of the page, or use the [contact page].

All the best!

###### **P.S.:** On our department website ([Demar]) you'll find the briefer [ComputEEL/MatSci institutional page](http://www.demar.eel.usp.br/laboratorio-computeel-matsci). But the whole site is hosted here (using [Jekyll] on [Github pages], by the way) since it is so much easier (and fun!) to maintain and update.
