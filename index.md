**{{site.title}}** is a Materials Science-dedicated computational group located at the **Materials Engineering Department** ([Demar], *Depto. de Engenharia de Materiais*) of the **Lorena School of Engineering** ([EEL], *Escola de Engenharia de Lorena*), part of  **University of São Paulo** ([USP], *Universidade de São Paulo*). It started in 2017 as a computational support group for a experimentally-driven research lab investigating  superconducting compounds at the department, but has since grown to be a fully functional and independent research group working on several areas of Materials Physics, such as superconductivity, magnetism, and thermodynamics. The focus of **{{site.title}}** is on ab-initio electronic-structure DFT calculations, thermodynamic modeling using the CALPHAD method, and simulation of thermal properties of alloys and intermetallic compounds.

###### **N.B.:** On our department website ([Demar]) you'll find the briefer [ComputEEL/MatSci institutional page](http://www.demar.eel.usp.br/labs/computeel-matsci.html). But the complete site is hosted here (using [Jekyll] on [Github pages], by the way) since it is so much easier (and fun!) to maintain and update. You can also access this page at [sites.usp.br/computeel](https://sites.usp.br/computeel/).
