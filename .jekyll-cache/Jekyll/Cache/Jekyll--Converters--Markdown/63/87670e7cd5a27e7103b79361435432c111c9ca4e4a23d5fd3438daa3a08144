<p>Today we managed to gather the whole <strong>ComputEEL/MatSci</strong>  team (not such a difficult task at all!) to a brand new photo just by the entrance of our department. Click on the image to see an enlarged version of us :smile: !</p>

<p>Find more information about each <strong>ComputEEL/MatSci</strong> member and our collaborators at the <a href="/computeel/team">team</a> profile pages.</p>

<p>That’s the second generation of the team. Most guys are with us for less than a year. Let’s keep up the work with our new blood, as we say around here.</p>
