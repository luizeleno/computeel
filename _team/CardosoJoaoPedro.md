Born in 2001 in the countryside of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Ever since I can remember I've been curious about how much knowledge people are able to obtain and how through knowledge and research we can change the world around us, making true the phrase: "there is always an explanation for everything". From that perspective, Materials Engineering got me after so many uncertainties and brought me directly to EEL-USP (Lorena School of Engineering). At this new phase of my life, I met Prof. Luiz T. F. Eleno who introduced me to his scientific projects linked to computational physics and the world of quantum physics. Since then, I've joined his group called ComputEEL and started my undergraduate project that correlates computer calculation methods with the physics of materials engineering.
