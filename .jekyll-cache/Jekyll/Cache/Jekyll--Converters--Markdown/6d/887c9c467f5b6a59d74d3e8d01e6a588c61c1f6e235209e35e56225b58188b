<p>I was born in 1976 in São Paulo (SP), Brazil. I finished my graduation in Metallurgical Engineering from the <strong>Polytechnic School</strong> (<a href="https://www.poli.usp.br/">EP-USP</a>, <em>Escola Politécnica</em>) of the University of São Paulo (<a href="https://www5.usp.br/">USP</a>) in 2001, and soon started my master’s degree in the same institution, with the <a href="http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3133/tde-21102003-094851/pt-br.php">dissertation</a> <em>“Incorporation of Volume as a variable in the Cluster Variation Method”</em> (in portuguese), defended in 2003. After that, I moved to Germany, where I spent four and a half years stewing on beer and working at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Iron Research</strong> (<a href="https://www.mpie.de/">MPIE</a>, <em>Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung</em>) in  Düsseldorf from 2003 to 2008. There I fell (literally) from the train, breaking my right leg, inside which I still carry three pins and a metal plate - sealing my symbiosis with Metallurgy. Soon after, and still on crutches, I met the love of my life, also from São Paulo, coincidences. We went together to Toulouse, France, for another six months, where I was a guest researcher at the <strong>Université de Toulouse</strong>’s <em>Center Interuniversitaire de Recherche et d’Ingénierie des Matériaux</em> (<a href="http://www.cirimat.cnrs.fr/?lang=fr">CIRIMAT</a>. We then returned to Brazil, where I defended my <a href="http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3133/tde-05122012-165651/pt-br.php">doctoral thesis</a> titled <em>“Empirical and ab initio data in the CALPHAD method: the Fe-Cr-Mo-C and Nb-Ni-Si systems”</em> (in portuguese) in 2012 at EP-USP. Right after, I dedicated myself to a Post-Doctorate in Physics in the <strong>Institute of Physics</strong> (<a href="http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/">IF-USP</a>, <em>Instituto de Física</em>) of USP until 2014. Finished that, my activities began as a professor in the Department of Materials Engineering (<a href="http://www.demar.eel.usp.br/">Demar</a>), part of the Lorena School of Engineering (<a href="https://site.eel.usp.br/">EEL</a>) of USP, in the city of Lorena, São Paulo, where I finally tied my mule, which I sometimes untie to enjoy beer around the world. When I am not dedicating myself to these activities, I perform ab-initio and CALPHAD calculations, probing into the electronic and thermal properties of materials for several applications. I also teach Thermodynamics, Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics and Scientific Computing to future Materials and Physical Engineers.</p>
