Today we managed to gather the whole **{{site.title}}**  team (not such a difficult task at all!) to a brand new photo just by the entrance of our department. Click on the image to see an enlarged version of us :smile: !

Find more information about each **{{site.title}}** member and our collaborators at the [team] profile pages.

That's the second generation of the team. Most guys are with us for less than a year. Let's keep up the work with our new blood, as we say around here.
