Two team members of {{site.title}}, [Luiz T. F. Eleno] and [Igor Hideki],  are taking part in the *Autumn Meeting of the Brazilian Society of Physics* ([EOSBF2019]) in Aracaju, capital of the state of Sergipe, in northeastern Brazil.

Aracaju is a very hot town, full of beaches, coconut trees, crabs, shrimp and lots of natural beauties that makes it a splendid spot to hold a Physics conference!

Therefore, we came here to show our results on brand new work performed by our younger team member, [Igor Hideki], and also a proposal for a new python class to perform elasticity theory calculations --- more on that in the future.
