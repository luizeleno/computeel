title: "A. Manesco's PhD qualifying exam"
---

Today the qualifying exam of our theoretical collaborator, **[Antonio Manesco]**, will take place in our department. The title of the work is **"Quasi-unidimensional topological superconductivity in graphene"**, supervised by **[Prof. Durval Rodrigues Jr.]** and co-supervised by **[Prof. Gabrielle W. Martins]**, also our collaborator.

A *qualifying exam* is a typical step in PhD programs in Brazil, in which the candidate presents the ongoing work to a committee in order to verify whether the bibliographical review and the preliminary results obtained are compatible with the schedule originally planned, or else some steering proposals will have to be adopted.

Best of luck to Antonio and the people involved!
