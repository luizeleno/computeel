ComputEEL/MatSci was present in San Sebastián, Spain, for the workshop "Total Energy and Force Methods 2020". We presented the work entitled *"Controlling type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2 electronic and elastic properties via strain and alkaline-element intercalation"*

**Taken from the [workshop's website](http://totalenergy2020.dipc.org/){: target='_blank'}):**

*This workshop is organized within the “Total Energy and Force” conference series, which is held at ICTP in Trieste every odd year, and at a different place every even year. The previous most recent workshops of this "mini" series took place in Barcelona (2012), Lausanne (2014), Luxembourg (2016) and Cambridge (2018).*

*The main objective of this event is to identify new developments and topics in the field of electronic-structure methods from the first-principles perspective, their diverse applications, and its mathematical foundations. As such, it provides a great opportunity to assemble a wide range of leading scientists working on different aspects of computational material science.*
