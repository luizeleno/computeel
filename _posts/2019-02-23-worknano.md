The workshop **[WorkNano 2019]** - *"Materials Science addressed with modern analytical and theoretical methods"* was very successfully held at São Paulo from 21st to 22nd February 2019.

As I said in a previous news post, I was one of the speakers of the conference, with a short talk (15min) entitled *“Ab-initio DFT calculations applied to superconducting materials”*

You'll find a `pdf` file of [my talk] at this [Google Drive] repository, maintained by the workshop's main organizer, [Prof. Cristiano Oliveira], whom I congratulate for the great job!

You'll also find there the official picture of the conference. Unfortunately, I had a meeting elsewhere, at exactly the same time the picture was taken! Tell me about bad timing...
