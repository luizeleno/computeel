Born and raised in São Paulo, I’ve grown up fascinated with the influence of the relations that we establish with nature and others in the development of our personality. That fascination guided me through paths that made me perceive a mismatch between my ambitions and the possibilities of acquiring them, whereas trying to comprehend the relations among human and nature without ever knowing either very well.

From then on I’ve decided to start my undergraduate course in Engineering Physics searching for a deep learning of the universe. I've had my first contact with Materials Science and learned about the tremendous potential of Scientific Computing combined with that subject in the characterization of materials and in the understanding of the behavior of matter through Prof. Luiz Eleno, Pedro P. Ferreira and the beautiful job carried out by ComputEEL/MatSci Group, with whom I intend to perform my undergraduate research projects.
